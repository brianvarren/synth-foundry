This sketch:

### ✅ **Loads a WAV file from an SD card into PSRAM on an RP2040 board** (specifically using SPI1 on something like the Olimex Pico2-XXL), and prints info about the process.

---

### 🔍 Here's what it **actually does, step-by-step**:

---

#### 🧠 **1. Initializes External PSRAM**

* Verifies that the RP2040 board has external PSRAM.
* Prints its total size and current available heap.

> PSRAM is crucial here because WAV files can be large, and the RP2040’s internal SRAM (264 KB) wouldn’t be enough.

---

#### 💾 **2. Initializes an SD Card over SPI1**

* Sets up SPI1 with custom pins.
* Mounts the SD card using the fast `SdFat` library.
* Prints the total card size.

---

#### 📁 **3. Lists All `.wav` Files**

* Opens the root directory (`/`) on the SD card.
* Iterates through files and prints the name and size of each `.wav` file it finds.

---

#### 🎵 **4. Loads the First `.wav` File It Finds**

* Re-opens the root and searches for the first `.wav` file (alphabetical, not sorted).
* Reads the WAV header (just enough to check that it's a valid PCM format).
* Skips through chunks until it finds the `data` chunk.
* Verifies that there’s enough **free PSRAM** to hold the sample data.
* Uses `pmalloc()` to allocate memory in PSRAM.
* Loads the audio data in **32 KB chunks** from the SD card into PSRAM.
* Prints the read speed in MB/s.

> ⚠️ It does **not** parse all WAV formats. Just enough to verify PCM and locate raw sample data.

---

#### 🧪 **5. Dumps the First 32 Bytes of Audio**

* Just prints the first few bytes in hex to show the raw data loaded correctly.

---

#### 🌀 **6. `loop()` is Empty**

* This sketch runs once on boot, does its job, and then halts.

---

### 🛠️ **Use Case**

This sketch is essentially a **diagnostic loader** or **infrastructure test**. It's verifying that:

* PSRAM works
* SD card access is fast and reliable
* WAV files can be found, parsed, and loaded
* Large audio buffers can be read into memory

You could use this as the **first step in building**:

* A lo-fi sampler or wavetable synth
* A voice trigger system
* A granular playback engine
* Anything involving pre-recorded sample playback
